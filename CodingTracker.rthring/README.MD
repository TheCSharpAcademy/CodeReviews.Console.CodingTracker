# Coding Tracker
This is a C# application made to track time spent coding in a SQLite database.

# How It Works
-It uses a SQLite database in the applications working directory.  
-If no database exists then it will create one.  
-It then gives the user instructions through a console user interface  
-The user can then type 0 to close the application, 1 to view all records in the database, 2 to insert a new record, 3 to delete a record, or 4 to update a record
