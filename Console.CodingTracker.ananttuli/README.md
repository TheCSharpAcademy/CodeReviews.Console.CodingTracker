# CodingTracker

An application that helps users log their coding sessions.

## Features

### Create session

- Users can create sessions by entering the start time and end time
  of their session.

### View sessions

- Display all created sessions and duration.

### Update session by ID

- Users can update a session by ID (which can be found when viewing sessions)

### Delete session by ID

- Users can delete a session by ID (which can be found when viewing sessions)

## Run Locally (Development)

To run this locally,he application can be run locally via command line:

- Clone this repository
- `cd CodingTracker`
- `dotnet run`

## Tech Stack

- This C# console application uses `Dapper` to connect to an SQLite database.
- When the application starts, it should create a sqlite database,
  if one isnâ€™t present.
- It should also create a table in the database, where the sessions
  will be stored.
- Uses a App.config file to configure DB source.(see below for details)

## Code Organization

The source code has been organized into various modules/namespaces to
maintain separation of concerns:

### `CodingTracker/CodingTrackerProgram/Program.cs`

- Entrypoint

### `CodingTracker/CodingTrackerProgram/app.config`

- Config file, values can be changed dynamically

### `CodingTracker/CodingTrackerProgram/Database`

- Contains a `Connection` class to manage SQLite connection.
- `CodingSessionRepository` to query the database for habit logs.

### `CodingTracker/CodingTrackerProgram/Model`

- Contains the `CodingSession` model which encapsulates the data
  representing a session.

### `CodingTracker/Input`

- A library that contains convenient utilities to allow
  reuse user input utilities across the solution.
