## Challenges

- **Challenge 1**: First challenge I faced was in logging live coding session timer and getting the user's input at the same time.
- **Challenge 2**: Putting Files in different folders and organizing the code.
- **Challenge 3**: Reading Documentation.
- **Challenge 4**: Testing my whole code, when I refactor code to make sure everything is still working.
