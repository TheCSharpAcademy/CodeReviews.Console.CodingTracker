* **SQLite database**
  - the application uses an SQLite database to store and retrieve data
  - if a database doesn't exist it's created on startup
  - database is seeded with data generated by [Bogus](https://github.com/bchavez/Bogus) NuGet package
    
* **CRUD database operations**
  - create, update and delete or view all records for coding sessions
  - create goals and set the amount of coding hours to achieve in a time period
## Lessons learned
* creating and using "appsettings.json" configuration file
* working with [Dapper](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Dapper/) micro-ORM for CRUD operations
* using Spectre.Console for displaying tables and progress bars
* improved handling DateTime and TimeSpan values for various applications
