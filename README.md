# Coding Tracker

## Overview
Coding Tracker is a console application designed to help users track their coding sessions and manage their projects efficiently. It allows users to enter new coding sessions, view previous records, edit records, and delete records as needed.

## Features
- **Welcome Message**: Greets the user with a fancy ASCII art logo and instructions on how to navigate the application.
- **Track Coding Sessions**: Users can enter the start and end times of their coding sessions.
- **View Previous Records**: Users can view a list of their previous coding sessions, including start and end times, and the duration of each session.
- **Edit Records**: Users have the option to edit the details of their existing coding sessions.
- **Delete Records**: Users can delete any previously recorded session.
- **Exit Program**: Allows users to exit the application safely.

## How to Use
1. **Start the Application**: Run the application from your IDE or command line.
2. **Navigate the Menu**: Use the Up and Down arrow keys to cycle through options and press Enter to select.
3. **Follow Prompts**: Enter the required information as prompted for each action (e.g., start time, end time).
4. **View or Modify Records**: Choose the appropriate option from the main menu to view, edit, or delete coding session records.
5. **Exit**: Select the option to exit the application when finished.

## Lessons Learned
During the development of Coding Tracker, several key lessons were learned:
- **Code structure**: Without a good code structure, my code would be a bunch of messy classes 
- **The importance of user input validation**: Ensuring that the user inputs are valid before processing them prevents errors and improves the overall user experience.
- **Simplifying user interaction**: Keeping the user interface simple and intuitive is crucial for user satisfaction and engagement.
- **The value of clear documentation**: Writing clear and concise documentation helps users understand how to use the application and contributes to its overall success.

## Areas to Improve
While Coding Tracker serves its primary purpose, there are several areas where it could be improved:
- Add the possibility of tracking the coding time via a stopwatch so the user can track the session as it happens.
- Let the users filter their coding records per period (weeks, days, years) and/or order ascending or descending.
- Create reports where the users can see their total and average coding session per period.
- Create the ability to set coding goals and show how far the users are from reaching their goal, along with how many hours a day they would have to code to reach their goal. You can do it via SQL queries or with C#.
